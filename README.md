APPLICATION FOR PARKING SLOT IN VIT
Parking is one of the biggest problem we face. The increase in population has led to
heavy traffic due and overcrowding. The beauty of the area is not unveiled when
there are vehicles parked in the places where there are not supposed to be.The
objective of the project is to create interface for the users to know about location of
parking areas and know whether parking slot are available or not. This project
delivers an interface which the user can use to getthe number of parking slots
available at a location so that user can be well aware in advance about the situation
and by the interface we are going to provide, can find an alternative as it helps in
finding out other nearby locations.
